# BLG202E Numerical Methods
I did not like the class tbh so my opinion is a bit biased. The subject seems easy and many of my friends say it is, but I found it hard and I didnt enjoy studying for it at all. The homeworks were easy however as you just implement the alogrithim asked from the professor to you.
